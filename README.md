- **Frontend Development**: Built with **React** and **React Router** to create a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface with smooth navigation between pages.
- **Backend Development**: Developed the server using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle API requests, user authentication, and business logic for user and post management.
- **Database Management**: Utilized **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database, to store user profiles, posts, comments, and other data, offering scalable and efficient data management.
- **Follow Mechanism**: Implemented a feature where users can follow others and view posts from those they follow on their personalized feed.
- **Interactive Features**: Users can like, comment, and share posts, facilitating engagement and social interaction within the platform.

## Tech Stack Breakdown
